The goal is to build a service that store a list of services with names and periodically poll them.
This is my first time with Vert.x so I did not have time to write proper test in 4 hours.

LIST OF SERVICES:

List Services: GET localhost:8080/service
Add one Service: POST localhost:8080/service
Delete service by url: DELETE localhost:8080/service
Update Service name and userCookie: PUT localhost:8080/service

DONE:
-A user is able to add, update and delete a service (full functionality)
-Services are stored in the db, so they are kept when the server is restarted (as db I used the mysql image provided with docker)
-A basic UI built in react displays the name, url, creation time and status for each service. If you want to have a look, the code is in src/main/frontend.
Then the static files have been copied in resources/webroot.
-The result of the poller is automatically shown without reloading the page. This is done in the frontend but I could improve this and make the backend notify the client
when the poller has done its job and there are new status upd.
-A pattern regexp validator has been added to check URL to validate the url added by the user.
-Multi user support is done through the use of cookies. When we use a client (I used chrome and postman), cookies are created through UUID.randomUUID() and set in "kryClientCookie".
When GET localhost:8080/service is called, we will get the services added using POST localhost:8080/service from the same client.
For this reason the table service has a composite Primary Key made by url and userCookie.

TODO:
- Nice animation on add/remove services and make the ui pretty
- The service properly handles concurrent writes
- Protect the poller from misbehaving services (for example answering really slowly)
- Improve migration database using frameworks like FlywayDB

HOW TO RUN
- Run mysql on docker
- Download the project and open in Intellij
- Import the project in Intellij -> File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources and then select gradle -> Import from external model -> Gradle and select the gradle wrapper config
- Go inside kry-test and run ./gradlew clean build and the start the service run ./gradlew run
- Type in the browser http://localhost:8080 and you should see a page with the form to insert the service
